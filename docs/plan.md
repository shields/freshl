# Implementation plan

The design is locked in [comparison.md](comparison.md). This document is the
build plan: project scaffold, module layout, dependencies, build order, and
test strategy.

## Hard requirement: 100 % test coverage

Coverage is gated, not aspirational. Every line that ships must be exercised by
a test, with `coverage(off)` permitted only on `main` (per the
`right-answers/rust.md` convention). Concretely:

- `make coverage` runs `cargo +nightly llvm-cov --cfg coverage_nightly --fail-under-lines 100`
  and is a CI-blocking job.
- A PR that drops coverage below 100 % fails the same way a lint or test
  failure does. There is no "we'll backfill later" branch.
- New code lands with its tests in the same commit. If a code path is hard to
  cover (FFI fallbacks, OS-specific branches), the design changes to make it
  injectable rather than the coverage gate getting lowered.

## 0. Scaffold

**`Cargo.toml`** — single binary crate `freshl`, edition 2024, MSRV pinned to
current stable. Lints table mirrors `right-answers/rust.md`:

```toml
[lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "forbid"
unexpected_cfgs = { level = "warn", check-cfg = ['cfg(coverage_nightly)'] }

[lints.clippy]
all      = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }
nursery  = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }
cargo    = { level = "deny", priority = -1 }
```

**`src/main.rs`** — coverage cfg-gate on `main`:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]

#[cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, coverage(off))]
fn main() -> ExitCode { … }
```

**`rust-toolchain.toml`** — stable channel for normal builds; the coverage
workflow invokes nightly explicitly (`cargo +nightly llvm-cov`).

**`Makefile`** — `build`, `test`, `lint`, `fmt`, `coverage`, `run`. `lint` runs
`cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
`coverage` runs `cargo +nightly llvm-cov --cfg coverage_nightly
--fail-under-lines 100`.

**`lefthook.yml`** — prettier on staged `*.md`, matching `right-answers`.

**`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`** — `ubuntu-24.04`, SHA-pinned actions,
workflow-level `permissions: contents: read`, concurrency block from
`right-answers/ci.md`. Jobs: `test` (runs `make lint test`) and `coverage` (a
separate job that calls `make coverage` on the nightly toolchain). Both must
pass for merge.

**`.github/renovate.json5`** — `config:best-practices`,
`:semanticCommitsDisabled`, `platformAutomerge`, automerge for non-major and
dev deps.

**`.gitignore`** — `target/`, `*.profraw`, `lcov.info`.

**`README.md`** — one paragraph plus a link to the design doc. No
"why I built this," no installation theatre.

## 1. Dependencies (initial picks)

| Crate           | Purpose                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `anstyle`       | ANSI styling primitives                                |
| `anstream`      | `NO_COLOR` / isatty-aware stdout                       |
| `terminal_size` | Width detection for the multi-path section labels      |
| `jiff`          | Epoch `mtime` → ISO 8601 UTC string                    |
| `uzers`         | uid/gid → name with numeric fallback                   |
| `gix`           | Repo discovery and status; pure Rust, no libgit2       |
| `rustix`        | `statx` (Linux casefold) and `pathconf` (macOS) probes |

`rustix` is preferred over raw `libc` / `nix` because `unsafe_code = "forbid"`
rules out direct FFI, and `rustix` exposes safe wrappers for the syscalls we
need. No `clap`, no `chrono`, no `colored`.

```

## 3. Build order

Each step is a small commit with tests in the same commit. Coverage stays at
100 % at every step; if a step would drop it, fix the gap before moving on.

1. **Scaffold** — `cargo init --bin`, lint table, Makefile, `main.rs`
   returning `ExitCode::SUCCESS`, CI smoke job. Verification:
   `make lint test coverage` green.
2. **Arg parsing** (`args.rs`) — manual loop over `std::env::args()`.
   Recognises `--help`, `--version`, `--`, plus positional paths. On unknown
   flag, error with exit 2 (matches `ls`).
3. **Entry collection** (`entry.rs`, `collect.rs`) — `readdir` returns
   `Vec<Entry>` with `name`, `path`, `kind`, mode, nlink, uid, gid, size,
   mtime, symlink target. Always-hidden (no filter). Uses
   `std::fs::symlink_metadata` so symlinks are not followed.
4. **Owner resolution** (`owner.rs`) — `uzers::get_user_by_uid` with a
   `HashMap<u32, OsString>` cache, numeric fallback when lookup returns
   `None`.
5. **Case detection** (`case.rs`) — `rustix::fs::pathconf(_, PC_CASE_SENSITIVE)`
   on macOS; on Linux query `statx` for `STATX_ATTR_CASE_FOLD` if the file has
   it set (default = sensitive). Cache per-directory.
6. **Sort** (`sort.rs`) — comparator: dir first, then by name. Name comparison
   is natural-order (`f2` < `f10`), case sensitivity per result of step 5.
   Implement natural-order inline (≈30 lines) rather than pull in a crate.
7. **Formatting — non-git path**:
   - `perms.rs`: `(mode & 0o777)` → `"{:o}"`.
   - `size.rs`: emit raw digits, right-aligned to the widest entry in the
     listing. Digits past the leading six-digit-aligned group are dimmed so
     the megabyte/terabyte boundary is visible without altering the text.
   - `time.rs`:
     `jiff::Timestamp::from_second(secs).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")`.
     Styling: split at `T` and `Z`, dim those two characters with `anstyle`.
   - `name.rs`: ANSI color by kind. Symlinks rendered `name → target` with
     the arrow dimmed; target red if broken (lstat of target fails).
   - Column widths computed in one pass over the rows after collection.
   - `mod.rs`: stitches columns with single-space separators, in order: type ·
     mode · nlink · owner · group · size · timestamp · (git) · name.
     Right-aligns mode / nlink / size; left-aligns owner / group / name.
8. **Top-level wiring** — render to `anstream::AutoStream` so `NO_COLOR` and
   non-tty drops styling. File arg → single row. Multiple paths →
   blank-line-separated, each prefixed with a `<path>:` label line, matching
   `ls`.
9. **Git column** (`git.rs`, `format/git_col.rs`):
   - At start of a listing run, attempt `gix::discover` from each listed
     directory. Cache the result; if no repo, the column is omitted for that
     whole listing.
   - For each entry inside a repo, classify with one porcelain-equivalent
     snapshot. Map to two-char code: `M` / `A` / `D` / `R` / `C` / `T` / `U` /
     `??` / `!!`. Tracked + clean → `✓` (left column, right blank).
   - Ignored files: filename rendered with `Style::dim()` in addition to `!!`
     in the git column.
10. **Coverage hardening** — by this point coverage has been enforced at every
    step. Final pass: review any branches that needed contortion to cover, and
    refactor where the test shape is uglier than the production shape.

## 4. Tests

**Unit (in-module `#[cfg(test)]`):**

- `format::perms`: `0o755` → `"755"`; `0o644` → `"644"`; `0o7777` → `"7777"`
  (sticky / setuid only when set).
- `format::size`: 0 → `"0"`, 123 → `"123"`, 999_999 → `"999999"`,
  1_000_000 → `"1000000"` with `000000` dimmed, 1_234_567_890 →
  `"1234567890"` with `567890` dimmed, 999_999_999_999 → `"999999999999"`
  with the trailing six digits dimmed.
- `format::time`: fixed `SystemTime` epoch → expected ISO string. Test that
  `T` and `Z` get the dim style attached.
- `sort`: natural-order ordering across a fixture name list; verify dirs-first
  regardless of casing.
- `case`: behaviour-tested via a temporary HFS+ image is overkill; instead
  inject the detector with a stub and test the comparator's response to both
  modes.
- `args`: each known flag set; unknown flag → error.

**Integration (`tests/integration.rs`):**

- Build a tempdir with: regular file, hidden file, directory, broken symlink,
  valid symlink. Run the binary; assert exact output for stable columns and
  pattern-match the mtime column.
- Repeat inside a git repo (constructed via `gix`) covering: untracked,
  ignored, staged-modified, worktree-modified, tracked-clean. Assert each
  row's git column.
- Multi-path: pass two dirs; assert label lines and section separation.
- File arg: pass a single file path; assert one row, no label.
- `NO_COLOR=1`: assert no ANSI escapes anywhere.

**Coverage gate:** `--fail-under-lines 100`. `error.rs` paths covered by
negative tests (nonexistent path → exit 2). Any module that resists 100 %
gets refactored, not exempted.

## 5. Risks and open items

- **`statx` + casefold availability**: requires kernel ≥ 5.2 and a filesystem
  that reports the flag. Fallback: assume case-sensitive when the syscall does
  not return casefold info; document the assumption in `case.rs`.
- **`gix` status performance** on large repos: acceptable for v1. If it
  dominates wall time, scope to "stat the index, skip the workdir scan" later.
  Not optimising on day one.
- **Owner column width** on systems with long usernames: column auto-sizes
  per listing; no hard cap.
- **`uzers`** is a fork of the unmaintained `users` crate — confirm it still
  publishes. If not, switch to a tiny hand-rolled `getpwuid` / `getgrgid`
  wrapper via `rustix` (still no `unsafe`).

## 5a. Sort and recursion flags

After the core listing path is stable, the next layer adds the four most-used
GNU ls sort and recursion flags plus a ripgrep-style escalation modifier:

- `-S` (size, largest first) and `-t` (mtime, newest first) extend `sort.rs`
  with a `SortKey` enum and a keyed comparator. Both keep directories grouped
  first; the key only controls within-group order.
- `-r` reverses the within-group order via `Ordering::reverse` (preserving
  sort stability), still without disturbing the dirs/files split.
- `-R` introduces depth-first recursion driven from `lib.rs`. Each visited
  directory is rendered as its own labeled block. Symlinks to directories are
  never followed.
- `-u` / `-uu` gate the descent: by default `-R` skips hidden (dot-prefix)
  and gitignored directories; `-u` enables gitignored descent; `-uu` enables
  hidden descent as well. The rows are still listed in every case — only the
  descent is gated.

Short flags may be bundled (`-Rt`, `-Sr`, `-Ruu`, …). Coverage for every new
branch lands with the implementation.

## 6. First commit after approval

Scaffold only (step 0 from § 3): `cargo init`, lint table, Makefile, CI
workflow, lefthook, renovate, stub `main()`. `make lint test coverage` must
pass before the commit lands — 100 % coverage on a do-nothing binary is the
easy case, and the gate is in place from commit one. Subsequent commits each
add one numbered step from the build order.
